# UNO GLOBAL AI — ENTERPRISE ANALYTICS & DECISION INTELLIGENCE

**Author:** KalyanDataGuy  
**Type:** End-to-End Enterprise Analytics Portfolio  
**Status:** Logic-complete | GitHub-ready  
**Data:** Synthetic in source, enterprise-realistic in behavior

---

## Project Overview

Uno Global AI is **not a dataset-driven analytics project**.  
It is a **designed enterprise analytics system**.

Instead of starting with existing data, I first designed a realistic global AI consulting firm — defining **how it expands, hires, allocates talent, prices work, and generates profit over time**.  
Only after those constraints were fixed did data exist.

The result is a **causally connected analytics system** where:

**People → Projects → Revenue → Profit → Strategy**

are linked by logic, not assumptions.

This project demonstrates **systems thinking, data modeling discipline, and ownership of business logic end to end**.

## What This Repository Contains

### 📊 Canonical Master Dataset
- **`data/KalyanDataGuy_UnoGlobalAI_MASTER_2025 For GitHub.xlsx`**
- **9 sheets total**
  - 1 Author / IP / Notice sheet  
  - 8 core analytical sheets (Employees, Projects, Allocation, Financials, etc.)

This Excel file is the **single source of truth** for all analysis.

---

### 🧠 Enterprise Data Model
- **`visuals/UNOGLOBALAI_Data_Model.png`**

Shows:
- table grain
- primary & foreign keys
- how Employees, Projects, Allocation, Financials, and Strategy connect

The model is **tool-agnostic** and works cleanly across Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI, and Tableau.

### 📈 Executive-Style Visuals (Portfolio-Safe)

Located in `visuals/`:

1. Active Revenue — Year-on-Year  
2. Revenue vs Profit  
3. Region Profitability Ranking  
4. Project Budget Concentration (Pareto)  
5. Revenue per FTE by Country  
6. Utilization Heatmap (Region × Quarter)  
7. Talent Value vs Cost  
8. Strategic Project Coverage  
9. Project Cost vs ROI  
10. Strategy Timeline vs Revenue  

These represent **CXO-level decision views**, not charting demos.

## Documentation

Located in the `docs/` folder:

- **`DATA_DICTIONARY.md`**  
  Column-level definitions for **all 9 sheets**, including author/IP page

- **`ANALYTICS_PLAYBOOK.md`**  
  How insights can be derived using:
  - Excel
  - SQL
  - Python
  - Power BI
  - Tableau

- **`PROJECT_STORY.md`**  
  The design and reasoning behind the project:
  - why the company was designed before the data
  - how constraints shape analytics
  - why the data behaves like a real enterprise system

## Core Design Principles

- **Business-first modeling** — data exists because operations exist  
- **Real-world constraints enforced**
  - hiring waves by geography
  - region-specific salary logic
  - capacity-based allocation (no over-utilization)
  - revenue explained by people, not assumptions
- **Time-aware design**
  - year / quarter logic embedded
  - strategic events explain trend shifts
- **Tool independence**
  - same model works across Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau

## How to Review This Project

Recommended review flow:

1. Scan this **README** for scope  
2. View the **Data Model PNG**  
3. Inspect a few **executive visuals**  
4. Refer to the **DATA_DICTIONARY** for rigor  
5. Read **PROJECT_STORY.md** for design thinking

This mirrors how real analytics work is evaluated.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Enterprise-grade data modeling  
- Workforce + financial analytics integration  
- Allocation-driven cost logic  
- Strategy → event → metric traceability  
- Ownership of assumptions and consequences  

This is closer to an **internal analytics platform** than a tutorial project.
