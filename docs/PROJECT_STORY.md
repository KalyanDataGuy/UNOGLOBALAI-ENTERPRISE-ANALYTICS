## What This Project Actually Is

Uno Global AI is not an analytics exercise built on top of existing data.  
It is a **designed enterprise system**, where data exists only because realistic business decisions required it to exist.

This project began with a simple but difficult question:

**“If I were building a real global AI consulting firm from zero, what decisions would I be forced to make — and what data would inevitably emerge?”**

Everything in this repository is the consequence of answering that question honestly.

## Designing the Company Before the Data

Instead of importing datasets, I first defined **operating constraints**, the same way a founder or leadership team would:

- Which countries make sense for expansion, and in what order  
- How salaries differ by geography, role, and market maturity  
- How fast hiring realistically occurs (not all at once)  
- How projects originate from client domain and region alignment  
- How people can only be allocated up to human capacity  
- How revenue and profit must be explainable from staffing decisions  

Only **after these constraints were fixed** did rows and columns exist.

Data was not downloaded.  
Data was **earned through design**.

## Why the Data Behaves Like a Real Organization

Although the company is fictional, the **rules are real**:

- Every employee has a geography-true name, salary, and hire timing  
- Employee IDs encode location and expansion phase  
- Hiring happens in waves, not uniformly  
- Projects have budgets, timelines, ROI, and ESG context  
- Allocation links people to projects by quarter and percentage  
- Financials roll up from allocation cost, not assumptions  

As a result, trends in revenue, margin, utilization, or attrition are **causally explainable**, not just visually observable.

This is organizational behavior expressed numerically.

## The Core Engines of the System

The master workbook is structured around four tightly connected engines:

### 1. Workforce Engine
Employees are modeled with realistic attributes: country, role, salary, tenure, performance, and exit behavior.  
This enables credible headcount, cost, performance, and attrition analysis.

### 2. Project & Allocation Engine
Projects are not labels — they consume people.  
The Employee × Project × Quarter allocation bridge is where utilization, bench, cost, and strategic deployment become visible.

### 3. Financial Engine
Revenue, expense, profit, and margin are driven by the same headcount and allocation logic seen elsewhere in the model.  
There are no “magic numbers” — staffing changes explain financial outcomes.

### 4. Strategy & Events Layer
Strategic milestones (new regions, pricing shifts, market changes) exist so that performance trends can be explained with context, not speculation.

## Tool Independence by Design

This project was deliberately modeled to be **tool-agnostic**.

The same canonical structure supports:
- Excel (pivots, formulas)
- SQL (joins, window functions)
- Python (dataframes, modeling)
- Power BI / Tableau (semantic models, dashboards)

The data model does not change.  
Only the lens does.

This mirrors how real analytics platforms work.

## Why This Is Different from Typical Portfolio Projects

Most analytics portfolios start with data and ask what insights can be extracted.

This project started with **how a business actually operates**, then allowed data to emerge naturally.

It demonstrates:
- Systems thinking, not isolated analysis  
- Ownership of assumptions, not borrowed datasets  
- Design tradeoffs, not cosmetic metrics  
- End-to-end causality from people → projects → money → strategy  

It is closer to an internal enterprise analytics foundation than a tutorial or demo.

## How This Project Is Intended to Be Read

This repository is not meant to be skimmed line by line.

A realistic review flow is:
1. Scan the **README** for scope and intent  
2. View the **Data Model PNG** to understand structure  
3. Inspect a few **executive visuals**  
4. Refer to the **Data Dictionary** for rigor  

If the logic holds, the data earns trust.

## Closing Note

This project was built deliberately, slowly, and alone — enforcing realism at every step.  
If a rule broke, downstream numbers broke.  
That fragility is what makes the system believable.

You may disagree with individual design choices.  
But none of them are accidental.
